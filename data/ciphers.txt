Never make a mountain out of a mole-hill
As bold as brass
Behind bars
Burn the candle at both ends
Know which side one's bread is buttered
Fiddle while Rome burns
Break the news
A wet blanket
Get one's feet wet
To go bananas
The brains behind the operation
At the helm of the organization
There are pros and there are cons
Blind spot
With dirt never washed away
It rings a bell
Keep one's fingers crossed
Pushing it off the water
Keeping the water at bay
Burning a bridge
Preventing the tiredness at bay
Raining cats and dogs
Keep things on the safe side
Taking one's breath away
Breaking the ice in the conversation
A cog in the machine
Making up one's mind
Getting one's act together
Far fetched
Knocking one's socks off
Don't judge a book by it's cover
Getting on one's nerves
Nearly hitting the ceiling
Double-down
Being ahead of time
It's time to turn the tables
Taking a bull by the horns
Join the club
On the clock
The other side of the coin
Out of one's pocket
Penny-pincher
Stop on the dime
Strapped for cash
To pick at someone's brains
Ten a penny
Being a stretch
That and fifty cents will buy one a cup of coffee
Two sides of the same coin
It's worth the weight in good
Scrapping at the bottom of the barrel
Lightning fast
Word of mouth
Shooting the breeze
Faking it until one makes it
On top of the world
To stand a chance
On the cards
Preserved in mint condition
Buckle down
Happy go lucky
On board
Putting cards on the table
Back to the wall
Sweep under the rug
One's big mouth
Playing cat and mouse
To have a green thumb
Going out on a limb
In cold blood
In broad daylight
Cut the cord
Going to have to hit the road
Bright spark
Waiting time
Jumping on the bandwagon
Storm in the teacup
When it's too close for comfort
No picnic
Feeling blue
So far so good
Getting out of hand
Flying off the handle
To spill the beans
When the tables have turned
Grasping at straws
Out of thin air
Hold your horses
Building from the ground up
Shooting for the stars
The fruits of one's labor
Knocking on wood
Jumping the shark
Lucky two-shoes
Cooking with gas
Vanilla
Being far-fetched
No-brainer
All brawn and no brain
Stopping in one's tracks
Gearing up
At the end of the road
The eyes of a hawk
Going down the drain
Breaking loose
To break bread
