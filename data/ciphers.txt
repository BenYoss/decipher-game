Never make a mountain out of a mole-hill
As bold as brass
Behind bars
Burn the candle at both ends
Know which side one's bread is buttered
Fiddle while Rome burns
Break the news
A wet blanket
Get one's feet wet
To go bananas
The brains behind the operation
At the helm of the organization
There are pros and there are cons
Blind spot
With dirt never washed away
It rings a bell
Keep one's fingers crossed
Pushing it off the water
Keeping the water at bay
Burning a bridge
Preventing the tiredness at bay
Raining cats and dogs
Keep things on the safe side
Taking one's breath away
Breaking the ice in the conversation
A cog in the machine
Making up one's mind
Getting one's act together
Far fetched
Knocking one's socks off
Don't judge a book by it's cover
Getting on one's nerves
Nearly hitting the ceiling
Double-down
Being ahead of time
In the thick of it
It's time to turn the tables
Taking a bull by the horns
Join the club
On the clock
The other side of the coin
Out of one's pocket
Penny-pincher
Stop on the dime
Strapped for cash
To pick at someone's brains
Ten a penny
Being a stretch
That and fifty cents will buy one a cup of coffee
Two sides of the same coin
It's worth the weight in gold
Scrapping at the bottom of the barrel
Lightning fast
Word of mouth
Shooting the breeze
Fake it until one makes it
On top of the world
To stand a chance
On the cards
Preserved in mint condition
Buckle down
Happy go lucky
On board
Putting cards on the table
Back to the wall
Sweep under the rug
One's big mouth
Playing cat and mouse
To have a green thumb
Going out on a limb
In cold blood
In broad daylight
Cut the cord
Going to have to hit the road
Bright spark
Waiting time
Jumping on the bandwagon
Storm in the teacup
When it's too close for comfort
No picnic
Feeling blue
So far so good
Flying off the handle
To spill the beans
When the tables have turned
Grasping at straws
Out of thin air
Hold your horses
Building from the ground up
Shooting for the stars
The fruits of one's labor
Knocking on wood
Jumping the shark
Lucky two-shoes
Cooking with gas
Getting out of hand
Vanilla
Being far-fetched
No-brainer
All brawn and no brain
Stopping in one's tracks
Gearing up
At the end of the road
The eyes of a hawk
Left in the dust
Going down the drain
Breaking loose
Break bread
Cold as ice
Every cloud has a silver lining
Get a taste of your own medicine
Giving the cold shoulder
Wild goose chase
Home James
Comparing apples to oranges
Don't put all of the eggs in one basket
Bigger fish to fry
Ignorance is bliss
Piece of cake
A chip off the old block
Thin ice
A wrinkle in time
Packing heat
Tie up loose ends
You live and you learn
Look before you leap
Once in a blue moon
Pulling someone's leg
Famous last words
The best thing since sliced bread
Slow and steady wins the race
A bolt from the blue
The calm before the storm
On the fritz
Pulling it together
The last straw
On the ball
On the verge of a breakthrough
A stitch in time saves nine
An eye for an eye
There are clouds on the horizon
Through thick and thin
Time is money
When it rains it pours
The end of the line
Don't let me down
Well two can play at that game
Setting the game plan
No strings attached
In a jiffy
Letting loose
On the verge of collapse
It's not over until it's over
Two brains are better than one
Great minds think alike
The fact of the matter
One can do it with their eyes closed
Sitting ducks
No wammies
Getting the heebie jeebies
The best of both worlds
That's the way the cookie crumbles
Whatever floats your boat
The Jack of all trades
At the other end of the spectrum
Food for thought
A head of the game
